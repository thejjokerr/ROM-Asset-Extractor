* [üöÄ Extracting assets from a .gba ROM file](#Usage)
* [üéÆ Using extracted assets in a Unity game](#Using-extracted-assets-in-a-Unity-Game)




## Usage

The tool will extract all sprites, maps and tilesets to the specified directory ( `output`  by default)



### Command line

*Example:* `RomAssetExtractor.Cli.exe --rom "path/to/rom.gba" --sb false`

**All possible commands:**

    --rom or -r (required)
            The path to the Pok√©mon ROM to extract assets from.
    
    --output or -o
            The path to where the assets should be extracted.
            Defaults to: output
    
    --save-bitmaps or -sb
            Indicate that bitmaps should be saved alongside data by specifying True or False.
            Defaults to: True
    
    --save-trainers or -st
            Indicate that trainers should be saved alongside other data (and bitmaps) by specifying True or False.
            Defaults to: True
    
    --save-maps or -sm
            Indicate that maps should be saved alongside other data (and bitmaps) by specifying True or False.
            Defaults to: True
    
    --save-map-renders or -smr
            Indicate that full map renders should be saved alongside the tileset bitmaps by specifying True or False.
            Defaults to: False



### As Library in your own project

If you include the **RomAssetExtractor/RomAssetExtractor.csproj** (or built dll-files) as a library in your project you can call the following asynchronous method from your code:

```csharp
await AssetExtractor.ExtractRom(
        "path/to/rom",      // (string) Where is the rom to extract assets from
        "path/to/output",   // (string) Where should the assets be output to
        shouldSaveBitmaps,  // (boolean) Should the bitmaps be saved (true)? Or only the JSON data (false)?
        shouldSaveTrainers, // (boolean) Should trainers be saved?
        shouldSaveMaps,     // (boolean) Should maps be saved?
        logTextWriter       // (TextWriter) An object that inherits System.IO.TextWriter to which some progress logs will be written.
);
```



### UI

Build and run the **RomAssetExtractor.Ui.exe** for a Windows Forms application with friendly UI:

## Using extracted assets in a Unity Game

You can find a crude MapBuilder class in the Unity project located in `./ExampleUnityGame`. It demonstrates how to parse the JSON and draw the tilemaps. It also includes some basic movement controls and animations for a FireRed/LeafGreen hero character.

**Notes:**

1. Animated images are stored as horizontal sheets containing all animation frames.
2. Collisions, behaviors, surfable areas, jumpable areas, etc. all included in `.json` data files. Each map has two json files:
   - JSON Object containing map information like: size, name and encounters.
   - JSON Array with data on each tile (file can be up to 2000KB for big maps). If a map is 40 by 20 tiles big, then there will be 800 entries in this file. Each tile is represented as a JSON Object.



### Versions
